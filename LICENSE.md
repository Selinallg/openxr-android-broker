This repository complies with the [REUSE specification](https://reuse.software/).
Each file is tagged with copyright holder(s) and license, where possible:
if this cannot be included in a given file, it is either in a similarly-named file with `.license` appended,
or in the repository-wide `.reuse/dep5` file for cases where adding the `.license` file would break the
build system, such as with Android resources.

The full text of all licenses referenced by these files may be found in the LICENSES directory.
